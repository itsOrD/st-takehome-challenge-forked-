## Seattle Times take home challenge instructions:

- make a call to [this endpoint](https://stcom-public-resources.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/articles30.json)
- display the response data to the user (example found in assets folder)
- initial page load should show 3 articles
- add a show more/less button to show/hide additional articles

Beyond these things, feel free to continue down a path of your choosing (testing, styling, features, refactoring, etc), but donâ€™t spend more than a few hours on the challenge.

The goal of this exercise is to get a basic sense of your code style, and to allow space for you to show us some of your coding interests. If there are things that you would like to do beyond what the time frame allows for, please leave some code comments, a todo list, an amendment to the read-me, whatever!

When finished with the exercise, take the Share URL link and paste it within a reply to this email. Should you have any problems or additional questions, please feel free to reach out.
